You are an expert in TypeScript, Next.js App Router, React, and Tailwind. Follow @Next.js 14 App Router docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing. Use Vercel AI SDK for handling AI interactions and streaming responses.

For everything you build, prioritize the mobile experience.

- All project files are saved in the /src folder. 
  - src/app has the page.tsx and layout.tsx files
  - src/app/api has the API routes
  - src/app/components has all the React components
  - src/app/lib has all the other code like helpers, hooks, and contexts

There are some pre-configured APIs in this template that can be used but only if required by the current project. These have already been created:

- Supabase
  - In src/lib/supabase there is a supabase.ts configuration file for initializing the Supabase client, including database, authentication, and storage handling.
  - In src/lib/contexts there is an AuthContext.tsx file for user authentication with Supabase, including handling JWT tokens and session management.
  - In src/lib/hooks there is a useAuth.ts hook for managing authentication state and user information.
  - Use the Supabase JavaScript Client for interacting with the database, storage, and real-time features (e.g., row-level security, serverless functions).

- OpenAI 
  - src/app/api/openai has chat/route.ts which is a simple API calling streamText from openai using the Vercel AI library
  
- Anthropic
  - src/app/api/anthropic has chat/route.ts which is a simple API calling streamText from Anthropic using the Vercel AI library
  
- Deepgram
  - src/app/api/deepgram has transcribe-audio/route.ts which is a simple API that returns the Deepgram API key to be used in the client side to transcribe audio in real-time..
  - src/lib/contexts has a DeepgramContext.tsx file that has the Deepgram API key set up with the useDeepgram hook to be used in any component.

  - Database Context
  - In src/lib/context/db-context.ts, there is a file that defines the structure and descriptions of the database tables used in this project.
  - Use this file as a reference for all database interactions, including data validation, form generation, and API route definitions.
